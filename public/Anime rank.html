<h1>The best animes according to NikoNi7</h1>
<h2>My top 3 animes of this and last year</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Code Geass (all seasons)</h3>
<p>This is an anime that tells the tale of an unfortunate son of a British emperor who fights against his whole family to liberate Japanese territories that they unrightfully occupied. It is a story about a friendship, love and ultimate self-sacrifice for the loved ones.</p>
<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>Action and horror anime full of action scenes and emotional bonds between characters. It has many plot twists that helped me stay engaged with the story for many seasons.

<h3>Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei</h3>
<p>Satirical anime that critiques modern day life and makes fun of social and cultural norms, concepts and its own characters</p>
